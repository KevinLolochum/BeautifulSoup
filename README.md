# Websrapping with BeautifulSoup
Beautifulsoup is a useful python tool for collecting data from webpages that have HTTP formats.

This repository contains a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/KevinLolochum/BeautifulSoup/blob/master/Webscrapping%20with%20Beautifulsoup.ipynb) showing how data can be collected from the web as well as well how such data can be cleaned in python.
